# Docker Compose with Bind Mount for Local Development
# Use this file if you need direct access to database files
#
# IMPORTANT: Before using, create the directory:
#   mkdir -p postgres_data
#
# Usage:
#   docker compose -f compose.local.yaml up -d
#
# This configuration uses a bind mount instead of a named volume.
# Pros: Easy access to database files, simple backups
# Cons: May have permission issues on some systems
